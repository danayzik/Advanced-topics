ToDo:
Remove code duplication in ActionStep
Deal with GetEntity being const/non const check gameMap functions for const or no const
^^ Make GameManager have a ref to Entity Manager? then overload getEntity with const and non const
change tankalgo vectors to vector of vector according to players
maybe remove playerIndex from tank entity
Exit out of backward mode if in backward mode and move != backward
Can go into reverse even when something is behind
check negative values in map settings
Add input_errors.txt errors that are fatal
Questions:
Without try in main, how can we exit gracefully if map loading fails?
strict key = value ordering in map? what if i do better and make it key based?
