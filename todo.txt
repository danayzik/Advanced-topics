ToDo:
Add proper dodging since tracking is perfect if not alone
make players inherit from another unifying class
Sniping tank doesn't perform correctly
Don't take info when 1 tank only is alive

Write about unordered set adding randomness

Sniping tank tries to dodge but doesn't check where to

Add dodging shells for chaser?


change TankMode to be in a proper namespace. rename utils.h

Cleanup doulbe check of isTank in fireShell from tank in battle info

rename tankalgo

2nd player

Don't approve getbattleinfo if in preparing reverse . what about in justenteredreverse?

Cleanup
Try catch map error

Allow lowercase letters in input txt, report it as small error. Same with misordering

Deal with GetEntity being const/non const check gameMap functions for const or no const


Exit out of backward mode if in backward mode and move != backward
Can go into reverse even when something is behind
check negative values in map settings
Add input_errors.txt errors that are fatal
Questions:
Without try in main, how can we exit gracefully if map loading fails?
strict key = value ordering in map? what if i do better and make it key based?
Check dying at the same time in diff shell steps




Things to clean at the end:
Rule of 5 for everything

Settings out of order works for me. ask if it's a problem on forums?
Change map file path to file name, get only the name
