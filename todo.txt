ToDo:

Comparative:

Make view to string somewhere to avoid code dup, currently in gameresultkey
Bad algo so -> throw error and exit
So load fail -> remove from registrar
Game exception -> write that the game failed to results somehow, don't make thread exit
finish writing to output file
write to error file
change files names to not have .so
remove createTankAlgo from registrar
Refactor entries somehow


Things in the end:
Gamemanager registrar private constructor and delete others
rule of 5 for all
cmake and make files
test with other so's
output files, errors for map/command line.when to exit?
Remove renderer? or move to simulator
