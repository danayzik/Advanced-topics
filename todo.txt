ToDo:
CHECK OffsetToDirection in direction.h

Algo:
Improve simple Algo
Make utilities like bfs/line of sight calculator etc..
Map without a path between tanks will crash currently due to BFS //possibly okay, think
Refactor distance as utility
Chasing shoots if in LOS and distance < 4

Remove binary heap

Action:
Change name/function for getFirstRotationAction, used in chasing_algo


GameMap:
Get simpler API for map.
Add different constructors to GameMap
Add create entities api to GameMap
Simplify API



GameManager:

Add different constructors to GameManager
40 steps after using all shells
Check move backward requests


Entities:
Think about 3 shell steps on first turn?



Players:
Make tanks for players const?


General:
Think about destructors
Think about object ownership
