ToDo:

make players inherit from another unifying class

Write about unordered set adding randomness



Don't approve getbattleinfo if in preparing reverse . what about in justenteredreverse?

Cleanup
Try catch map error

Allow lowercase letters in input txt, report it as small error. Same with misordering


Exit out of backward mode if in backward mode and move != backward

Can go into reverse even when something is behind
check negative values in map settings
Add input_errors.txt errors that are fatal
Questions:
Without try in main, how can we exit gracefully if map loading fails?
strict key = value ordering in map? what if i do better and make it key based?



Things to clean at the end:

Settings out of order works for me. ask if it's a problem on forums?
Change map file path to file name, get only the name
