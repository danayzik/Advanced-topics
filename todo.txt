ToDo:

Win not working
change TankMode to be in a proper namespace. rename utils.h
Improve algo

Factories
2nd algo
2nd player
Cleanup
Make player decide how algo's act?
Allow lowercase letters in input txt, report it as small error. Same with misordering

Deal with GetEntity being const/non const check gameMap functions for const or no const
^^ Make GameManager have a ref to Entity Manager? then overload getEntity with const and non const

Exit out of backward mode if in backward mode and move != backward
Can go into reverse even when something is behind
check negative values in map settings
Add input_errors.txt errors that are fatal
Questions:
Without try in main, how can we exit gracefully if map loading fails?
strict key = value ordering in map? what if i do better and make it key based?
Check dying at the same time in diff shell steps
Don't approve getbattleinfo if in preparing reverse . what about in justenteredreverse?


Things to clean at the end:
Rule of 5 for everything
Try catch on all errors from map file
Settings out of order works for me. ask if it's a problem on forums?
Change map file path to file name, get only the name
