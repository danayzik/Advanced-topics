Extra work added to this project for which we're requesting a bonus:

1) Extensive error recovery and documentation. Please see the README.md file for specific information on what types
   of errors are recovered successfully. Any recovered error will appear in input_errors.txt inside the running directory.

2) Little/granular locking. With my threading model, threads are able to quickly fetch the information of the game they
   need to run, with no collisions with other threads. See line 164 in Simulator/ComparativeSimulator.cpp

3) Custom exceptions for different error types, as can be seen in Simulator/Exceptions.h

4) With comparative mode, if a game manager crashed or returned an invalid game result, he is grouped with his kind
   and added to the list of results. This is in addition to the requested output format.

5) Mostly clean code style, architecture and class design. I worked really hard for everything to be fairly intuitive
   and structured

6) Helped a lot of my peers with their questions in the whatsapp group, I know you can't confirm this to be true,
   and you probably don't really care, but I might as well ask for another point :)

7) Not a bonus, but Amir mentioned that if we submit assignment 2 and 3 on time, he'll consider removing the point deduction
   from the late submission on assignment 1. We hereby request a removal of that 2 point deduction, raising our grade
   from 99 to 101.
